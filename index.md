This course can't cover all aspects of statistics and data with R.
There are many free resources to learn more about the topics, and indeed
to learn even broader topics! Some of these are listed here:

- [Modern statistics for modern biology](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/)
- [Data analysis for the life sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)
- [Orchestrating single cell analysis](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/)
- [Introduction to statistical learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
- [Elements of statistical learning (advanced)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
