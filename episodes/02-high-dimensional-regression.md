# Linear regression (recap)

Linear regression is a tool we can use to quantify the relationship
between two variables.


Linear regression with one predictor variable $x$ comprises the following 
equation

$$
    y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
$$


where $\epsilon_i$ is the *noise*, or the variation in $y$ that isn't explained
by the relationship we're modelling. We assume this noise follows a normal
distribution, that is:

$$
    \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

We can also write this using linear algebra (matrices and vectors) as follows: 

$$
    y = X\beta + \epsilon
$$


Another way of saying this is that y follows a normal distribution with

$$
    y \sim N(X\beta, \sigma^2)
$$

Or, visually, that (for example) this is the distribution 
of new points conditional on their $x$ values:


~~~
x <- cbind(rep(1, 100), rnorm(100))
beta <- rnorm(2)
sx <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 200)
sy <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 200)
fx <- cbind(rep(1, 200), sx) %*% beta

dens <- matrix(NA, 200, 200)
for (i in seq_along(sx)) {
    for (j in seq_along(sy)) {
        dens[i, j] <- dnorm(sy[[j]], mean = fx[[i]])
    }
}
image(sx, sy, dens, col = viridis::viridis(100, option = "magma"))

# Data

For the following few episodes, we'll be working with human
DNA methylation data from flow-sorted blood samples.
These come in the form of a matrix
of normalised methylation levels (M-values, for the technical among
you). Along with this, we have a number of sample phenotypes
(eg, age in years, BMI).

The following code will read in the data for this episode.


~~~
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library("minfi")
    library("limma")
    library("here")
    library("broom")
})

if (!file.exists(here("data/methylation.rds"))) {
    source(here("data/methylation.R"))
}
norm <- readRDS(here("data/methylation.rds"))

norm <- norm
X <- getM(norm)
~~~
{: .language-r}

The distribution of each of these looks like this:


~~~
hist(X, breaks = "FD", xlab = "M-value")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In high-throughput experiments like this, we commonly have one or more 
phenotypes that we want to relate to molecular features.
In this case, these phenotypes are as follows:

In this case, we will focus on age in years. The association between
age and methylation status in blood samples has been studied extensively,
and is actually a good case-study in how to perform some of the techniques
we will cover in this lesson.
The distribution of age in these samples is as follows:


~~~
y <- log(norm$Age)
hist(y, breaks = "FD", xlab = "log(Age)")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


~~~
library("pheatmap")
order <- order(y)
y_ord <- y[order]
X_ord <- X[, order]
pheatmap(X_ord,
    cluster_cols = FALSE,
    cluster_rows = FALSE,
    annotation_col = data.frame(
        log_Age = y_ord,
        row.names = colnames(X_ord)
    ),
    show_rownames = FALSE,
    show_colnames = FALSE
)

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We have a matrix of methylation values $X$ and a vector of ages in years $y$.
One way to model this is to see if we can "predict" methylation using age.
Formally we'd describe that as:

$$
    X_{i,j} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_j + \epsilon_i
$$

You may remember how to fit this model from a previous lesson, and how to
get more information from the model object:


~~~
fit <- lm(X[1, ] ~ y)
summary(fit)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Call:
lm(formula = X[1, ] ~ y)

We can also use `broom` to extract information about
the coefficients in this model:


~~~
library("broom")
tidy(fit)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 2 x 5
  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value
  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>

2 y              0.181     0.248     0.728  0.471 
~~~
{: .output}

We have a lot of features, though! This is what it looks like if we do that
for every feature.


~~~
dfs <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(X)),
    function(i) {
        df <- tidy(lm(X[i, ] ~ y))[2, ]
        df$term <- rownames(X)[[i]]
        df
    }
)
df_all <- do.call(rbind, dfs)
plot(df_all$estimate, -log10(df_all$p.value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)

# Multiple testing

## The problem of multiple tests

With such a large number of features, we often want some way
to decide which features are "interesting" or "significant"
for further study.

To demonstrate this, it's useful to consider what happens if
we scramble age and run the same test again:


~~~
y_perm <- y[sample(ncol(X), ncol(X))]
dfs <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(X)),
    function(i) {
        df <- tidy(lm(X[i, ] ~ y_perm))[2, ]
        df$term <- rownames(X)[[i]]
        df
    }
)
df_all <- do.call(rbind, dfs)
plot(df_all$estimate, -log10(df_all$p.value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)
~~~

## Adjusting for multiple comparisons

When performing many statistical tests to
categorise features, we're effectively classifying
features.

|              |Predicted true|Predicted false|
|-------------:|-------------:|--------------:|
|Actually true |True positive |False negative |
|Actually false|False positive|True negative  |


The t-statistic for a linear model like this is given by:

$$
    t_{ij} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{ij}}{SE(\hat{\beta}_{ij})}
$$

$SE(\hat{\beta}_{ij})$ measures the uncertainty we have in our effect
size estimate. 


Knowing what distribution these t-values follow under the null
hypothesis allows us to determine how unlikely it would be for
us to observe what we have under those circumstances.

# Sharing information

One idea is to take advantage of the fact that we're doing all these tests 
at once. We can leverage this fact to perform *shrinkage* of some model
parameters. Shrinkage methods can be complex to implement and understand,
but it's good to understand why these approaches may be more precise 
and sensitive than the naive approach of fitting a model to each feature
separately.



The insight of shrinkage methods is to realise that variance parameters
like these are probably similar between genes within the same experiment. This
enables us to share information between genes to get more robust
estimators.

In this case, 

not $j$ but rather $k$? for predictor.
$$
    t_{ij} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{ij}}{s_i \sqrt{v_{ij}}}
$$

$s_i^2$ is the variance of residuals.


Similarly, DESeq2 shares information between genes
to *shrink* estimates of a noise parameter, in that case to model counts.
